Fabulous idea if you ask me. You can even get two beers for $5. I mean who wouldn't want to go and get really yummy tacos and beer. Genius. Check it out. Totally worth it and it won't break the bank.

The tacos are practicaly bursting with fillings. Carne Asada and Pollo are very flavorful. Pass on the Carnitas - it is quite bland.\nThe atmosphere is very casual. Very cafetaria-like with vinyl table clothes and you order up front and then seat yourself at the first available table. The servers will bring your order to the table.  There are tvs - usually broadcasting sports. It is a great place to meet up with friends and hang out. There is a separate bar just for drinks if you wanted to pass on the eats. \n\nHorchatas are $3 - Almost the same price as cervezas - so make your choices wisely. Beer are $5 for two, but $4 for one.

I got my food to go. I didn't want to wait until I got home to test the crispy taco shell, so I tried one in the car. The \"shell\" was soggy with grease. They probably crowded the pan (or whatever they use) which then brings down the oil temperature. Any savvy cook knows that you need to keep the temperature consistently at xx degrees to keep food from absorbing the oil. Come on mi gente en la cocina...work it out.\n\nThe only thing crispy at Nick's was the money as it came out of my wallet. Not that it costs a lot to eat here, but this business is incorrectly named for sure.\n\nIf you're willing to drive out to Berkeley for some REAL crunchy tacos, then check out the reviews on my page.
